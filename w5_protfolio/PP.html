<p>This computer project require students to write a system for an organization who need car parking tickets program.</p>
<p>Note that support has been provided by teachers and for the system we can write in pseudocode or visual basic programming language. I choose to write in pseudocode as i was new to programming language.</p>

<p>An array of size 280 is reserved to store the license numbers. 280 because there are 20 parking 
    spaces and 14 days. (20 x 14 =280)
    An array of size 280 is reserved to store the visitors name. 280 because there are 20 parking 
    spaces and 14 days. (20 x 14 =280)
    Variable to which the User will input a number between 1 and 14.
    A string variable to input either ‘y’ or 
    ‘Y’ if the user needs to do more booking
    For a particular day we calculate the 
    starting range for the parking space.
    For a particular day we calculate the 
    ending range for the parking space.
    Input a day number between 1 and 14. 
    Perform a range check between 1 and 14. User should 
    input a value between 1 and 14.
    Compute Starting Range and ending range.
    If a parking space is found or free, 
    the found variable will be set to true. The parking number 
    allocated is calculated using the formula. User input vehicle 
    num and visitor name to store.Enter Y to clear all data and N to 
    not clear it. Clear all data from the array at the 
    end of the two weeks period.
