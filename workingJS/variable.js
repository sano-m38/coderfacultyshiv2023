// 1. Define and initialise two variables
//    a. name with the value `John`
//    b. single with the value `False`
// 2. Define a variable age and request the user to input his age and assign it to the variable age.
// 3. Print out the values of the variables
//     a. Output should be : 
//         i. `My name is John`
//         ii. `My age is 22`
// 4. Change the value of name to `Tom` and the value of single to `True`
// 5. Print the updated name
// 6. Print the name and the age in one single `print()` using string formatting


let name = "John";
let single = false 

let age = console.log("please enter your name") 

console.log(" please enter your age " + age )


// not what i am looking 



// create a function 

function welcom(name,age){
    // return ("my name is " + name + " my age is "+ age)    don't know why this one is now working 
    console.log("my name is " + name + " and my age is " + age)
}

welcom("san",44);   // pay attention need to add double quates on the name


// but still not what i am looking for, need this program to be interactive in the terminal for example like :
// please enter your 
// name and age then it display your 
// welcom name is ... and your age is ...
