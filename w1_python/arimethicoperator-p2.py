"""
1. Define two variables **`num1`** and **`num2`** and initialise them with any integer values.
2. Add **`num1`** and **`num2`** and store the result in a variable called **`sum`**.
3. Subtract **`num2`** from **`num1`** and store the result in a variable called **`difference`**.
4. Multiply **`num1`** and **`num2`** and store the result in a variable called **`product`**.
5. Divide **`num1`** by **`num2`** and store the result in a variable called **`quotient`**.
6. Calculate the remainder of **`num1`** divided by **`num2`** and store the result in a variable called **`remainder`**.
7. Print the values of **`sum`**, **`difference`**, **`product`**, **`quotient`**, and **`remainder`** using formatted strings.
